<paragraph xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Ethacrynic acid is an unsaturated ketone derivative of an aryloxyacetic acid. It is designated chemically as [2,3-dichloro-4-(2-methylene-1-oxobutyl)phenoxy] acetic acid, and has a molecular weight of 303.14. Ethacrynic acid is a white, or practically white, crystalline powder, very slightly soluble in water, but soluble in most organic solvents such as alcohols, chloroform, and benzene. Its empirical formula is C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>12</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and its structural formula is:</paragraph>
<paragraph xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Ethacrynate sodium, the sodium salt of ethacrynic acid, is soluble in water at 25Â°C to the extent of about 7 percent. Solutions of the sodium salt are relatively stable at about pH 7 at room temperature for short periods, but as the pH or temperature increases the solutions are less stable. The molecular weight of ethacrynate sodium is 325.12. Its empirical formula is C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>11</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>NaO<sub>4</sub> and its structural formula is:</paragraph>
